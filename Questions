INSTRUCTIONS: Write a C++ script/code to do the following problems. Save your work in the Github repository and
submit your Github repository URLs in the blackboard submission bin.

PROBLEM 1: The manager of a football stadium wants you to write a program that calculates the total ticket sales after
each game. There are four types of tickets—box, sideline, premium, and general admission. After each game, data is
stored in a file in the following form:

ticketPrice numberOfTicketsSold
...
Sample data are shown below:
250 5750
100 28000
50 35750
25 18750
The first line indicates that the ticket price is $250 and that 5750 tickets were sold at that price. Output the number of
tickets sold and the total sale amount. Format your output with two decimal places.



PROBLEM 2: Write a program that accepts as input the mass, in grams, and density, in grams per cubic
centimeters, and outputs the volume of the object using the formula: density ¼ mass / volume. Format your output to
two decimal places.



PROBLEM 3: Interest on a credit’s card unpaid balance is calculated using the average daily. Suppose that netBalance
is the balance shown in the bill, payment is the payment made, d1 is the number of days in the billing cycle, and d2 is
the number of days payment is made before billing cycle. Then the average daily
balance is:

averageDailyBalance = (netBalance * d1 – payment * d2) / d1

If the interest rate per month is say, 0.0152, then the interest on the unpaid balance is:

interest = (averageDailyBalance * 0.0152)

Write a program that accepts as input netBalance, payment, d1, d2, and interest rate per month. The program outputs
the interest. Format your output to two decimal places.
